                <h2>Non-Security Digital Collectibles</h2>
                <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> Pixel Ninja Cats are digital collectible items intended solely for entertainment and collectible purposes. They are NOT securities, investments, financial instruments, or any form of financial asset.</p>
                <p>When purchasing Pixel Ninja Cats, you are acquiring ownership rights to a digital piece of art in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT). You are NOT purchasing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An investment opportunity</li>
                    <li>Any rights to profits or revenue sharing</li>
                    <li>Any ownership stake in a company</li>
                    <li>Any form of financial security</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Pixel Ninja Cats are designed for collectors and enthusiasts who appreciate digital art, gaming, and collectibles. Any value derived from these NFTs is purely based on collector interest and market demand for the digital art, not on any investment scheme or business enterprise.</p>

                <h2>Fees and Transaction Costs</h2>
                <p>When minting or trading Pixel Ninja Cats, you may incur various fees, including but not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Minting fees charged for creating the NFT</li>
                    <li>Gas fees for processing transactions on the blockchain</li>
                    <li>Platform fees for marketplace transactions</li>
                    <li>Network fees which fluctuate based on blockchain congestion</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These fees are separate from the price of the Pixel Ninja Cat itself and are paid directly to the blockchain network or platform facilitating the transaction, not to us. We do not control these fees and they may vary significantly based on network conditions.</p>
                <p>We recommend reviewing all fees before confirming any transaction. By proceeding with any transaction, you acknowledge and accept responsibility for all associated fees.</p>

            <div class="disclaimer-section">
                <h2>AI Generation Process</h2>
                <p>Each Pixel Ninja Cat is created using advanced artificial intelligence technology:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Images are generated using OpenAI's DALL-E-3 AI image generation model</li>
                    <li>Each cat is a unique 32×32 pixel-art ninja cat sprite with specific traits</li>
                    <li>Images may be automatically cropped to remove palette strips and optimize visual presentation</li>
                    <li>The generation process includes deterministic but varied trait assignment based on the token ID</li>
                    <li>Metadata includes dynamically generated attributes, combat stats, backstory, and special abilities</li>
                    <li>Images and metadata are stored on IPFS for decentralized persistence</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While we strive for uniqueness and quality in each generated cat, the nature of AI generation means there may be similarities between certain elements. We do not guarantee absolute uniqueness of visual elements between different Ninja Cats.</p>
                <p>The generation process is subject to technical constraints and dependencies, including but not limited to AI model availability, IPFS services, and blockchain networks. In cases where the primary generation method fails, a fallback process ensures you still receive a complete Ninja Cat, though it may use alternative image sources.</p>
                <p>By minting a Pixel Ninja Cat, you acknowledge and accept the AI-generated nature of these collectibles.</p>
