        <h1>Ninja-Kitty&nbsp;Chronicles</h1>

        <div class="lore-section">
            <h2>Ancient Beginnings</h2>
            <p>Long before ERC-721 there was the secret order of Felidae Shinobi… In the shadowy valleys between digital and physical realms, a mysterious breed of warriors emerged. Neither fully feline nor entirely human, these nimble guardians began as ordinary house cats, transformed by an ancient blockchain incantation during the Great Bit-Eclipse.</p>
            <p>For centuries, they have protected the cryptographic barriers that separate our reality from the chaotic void beyond. Now, as the metaverse expands, they've decided to reveal themselves to worthy collectors who can carry their legacy forward.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lore-section">
            <h2>Star-Iron &amp; Whiskers</h2>
            <p>Their legendary blades are cast from meteor shards that fell on Vitruveo Genesis night - the cosmic event that birthed the very first blockchain. These katanas, known as "hash-slashers," can cut through code itself, defending against malicious smart contracts and digital demons.</p>
            <p>The most skilled ninja cats can extend their whiskers to sense disturbances in the network, detecting threats long before they materialize. It's said that a ninja cat can feel a gas fee spike three blocks before it happens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lore-section">
            <h2>The Four Great Clans</h2>
            <p>Each cat's four-tone palette marks its dojo lineage; the rarer the top/bottom banding, the higher its status among collectors. These colors are not merely aesthetic—they represent elemental affinities and fighting styles passed down through generations.</p>

            <div class="clan-section">
                <div class="clan-card">
                    <h3>Neon Shadow Clan</h3>
                    <p>Recognizable by their vibrant blue and purple highlights, the Neon Shadow cats are masters of digital stealth. They can phase through firewalls and move undetected through the most secure systems. Their ancestral home is the Midnight Server Farm, where they train in absolute darkness.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="clan-card">
                    <h3>Ruby Whisker Dynasty</h3>
                    <p>With distinctive red and orange patterns, Ruby Whisker ninjas are fierce combatants who specialize in frontline defense against crypto-threats. Their whiskers glow when danger approaches, and their roars can disrupt malicious mining operations. They're known for their loyalty and straightforward approach.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="clan-card">
                    <h3>Emerald Paw Society</h3>
                    <p>The green-tinted Emerald Paw cats are healers and builders, capable of repairing damaged code and restoring corrupted data. They maintain the ancient scrolls of blockchain wisdom and are often sought for their ability to optimize smart contracts for minimal gas consumption.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="clan-card">
                    <h3>Golden Mist Order</h3>
                    <p>The rarest of all clans, identified by their golden and yellow markings. These enigmatic cats possess the ability to see potential futures in the blockchain, anticipating forks and market trends with uncanny accuracy. Few have ever been seen, with rumors suggesting they only appear during major bull markets.</p>
                </div>

        <div class="lore-section">
            <h2>The Great Crypto Wars</h2>
            <p>During the infamous "51% Attack" of the ancient times, all four clans united to defend the nascent blockchain ecosystem. Led by the legendary Grand Meowster Satoshi (whose true identity remains unknown), they fought a shadow war against centralized powers that sought to control all digital assets.</p>
            <p>Victory was secured when the ninja cats performed the "Nine Lives Protocol" - a forbidden technique that splits a warrior's consciousness across multiple nodes, ensuring the network's survival at great personal cost. The brave cats who performed this ritual became the first NFTs, their spirits preserved forever in the immutable ledger.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lore-section">
            <h2>Training &amp; Abilities</h2>
            <p>Young ninja kittens train for years in the art of "Paw-Hash-Do" - a martial discipline that combines physical prowess with cryptographic mastery. They learn to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Perform "Scratch Attacks" that can penetrate even the most secure cold wallets</li>
                <li>Master "Purr Authentication" - a biometric technique impossible to spoof</li>
                <li>Execute the "Nine-Block Leap" allowing them to traverse great digital distances instantly</li>
                <li>Develop "Mempool Vision" - the ability to see pending transactions before confirmation</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="lore-section">
            <h2>Prophecy of the Rainbow Cat</h2>
            <p>Ancient scrolls speak of a day when a ninja cat bearing all clan colors will emerge as the "Rainbow Bridge Guardian." This legendary figure will unite all clans and lead them into a new era of prosperity, bridging separate blockchains into a harmonious ecosystem.</p>
            <p>Collectors whisper that certain rare combinations of traits might signal the arrival of this prophesied hero. Those who help discover this special cat may be rewarded with powers beyond imagination.</p>
